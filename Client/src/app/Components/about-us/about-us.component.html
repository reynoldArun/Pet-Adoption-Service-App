    <h1>Get to know us</h1>
    <h2>
      We know pet adoption, because we're adopters too. We think it's just about
      the best thing you can do. But we'll be real: it can be a lengthy
      (paperwork-filled) process. So we're making it easier, with the tools,
      advice, and transparency you needâ€”from the first search through to daily
      life as a pet parent. Because we'll do whatever it takes to help millions
      of people and pets find each other. Ready to find your pet? Let's do it.
